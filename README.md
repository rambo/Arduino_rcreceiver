Arduino-rcreceiver
==================

Simple interrupt-driven RC signal receiving library. This one is designed to take the individual channels from the receiver unit (very few units give out the full "signal train" of all channels in a single pin)

For now just an example sketch to show how to do this (It's really very simple so I'm not sure actualy library is going to be needed).

The sketch also implements a V-mixer to and drives a motor controller.

## TODO

  - Convert to library and make the sketch an example.
